# Introduction to Labs

These labs are intended to provide a practical complement to the CITS3006 Penetration Testing unit. The materials are designed for you to complete individually, but you are welcome to work with your peers as well. However, please note that the lab quizzes are **individually assessed**, so it is essential that you fully understand the concepts and techniques covered in the labs to receive good marks.

As always, please contact the lab facilitator if you are stuck. You will be asked to use the UWA Help Server to submit your question ticket, so that questions can be answered in the order of requests. The details are outlined in the welcome lecture slide, but you can also ask the lab facilitator on site or via their emails or through MS Teams. If nothing works, please contact the UC explaining your issue.

## Laptop Requirement

This unit requires software that the University IT team can't install on the lab machines and so you will need to use your own laptop. This can be either Windows, Mac or Linux and instructions will be provided for those platforms as necessary. We will be running (often) two or more VMs at the same time, so it is advisable to get a laptop that has high core counts (minimum 4), additional RAM (minimum 16GB), and enough storage space (extra 50GB in addition to whatever you use already). For further details on laptop specifications, you can see here: [https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/unitinfo/laptops.php](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/unitinfo/laptops.php)

If you do not have a laptop, it will make your life easier by getting one that meets the requirements specified in the above link.

Only in special cases, you may request a loan laptop from the student office. Please contact the Student Office to ask for more details: [studentwelfare-studserv@uwa.edu.au](mailto:studentwelfare-studserv@uwa.edu.au)

It is essential that you reserve at least 10GB of additional disk space to store the lab files (e.g., docker images). You can free disk space by removing completed lab files later.
